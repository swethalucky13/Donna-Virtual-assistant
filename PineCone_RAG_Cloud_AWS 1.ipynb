A campus of\\xa0Purdue University, Purdue Fort Wayne was founded on July 1, 2018, when its predecessor university,\\xa0Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne\\xa0formally split into two separate institutions: Purdue University Fort Wayne and\\xa0Indiana University Fort Wayne.[4]\\n\\nIts athletic teams are the\\xa0Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons.[5]\\xa0Most of the university\\'s 14 men\\'s and women\\'s athletic teams compete in\\xa0Division I\\xa0of the\\xa0NCAA\\xa0Horizon League; the men\\'s volleyball team competes in the\\xa0Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne §\\xa0History\\n\\nIn 1941,\\xa0Purdue University\\xa0permanently established the Purdue University Center in downtown Fort Wayne to provide a site for students to begin their undergraduate studies prior to transferring to the West Lafayette main campus to complete their degree. Twenty-four years earlier,\\xa0Indiana University\\xa0also began offering courses in Fort Wayne.[6]\\xa0From 1958–1964, both universities began the process of combining the two extension centers into one joint university, known as\\xa0Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne\\xa0(IPFW).\\n\\nIPFW opened on September 17, 1964, following nearly two years of construction on a 114 acres (0.46\\xa0km2) site northeast of downtown Fort Wayne. It awarded its first four-year degree in 1968.[6]\\xa0Eight years later, in 1976, IPFW absorbed the Fort Wayne Art Institute, an art school that had served the Fort Wayne community since 1897. In 1998, this academic unit was renamed the School of Fine and Performing Arts, later becoming the College of Visual and Performing Arts.\\n\\nAfter several years of talks between IPFW, Purdue, and IU, IPFW was divided into two universities on July 1, 2018: Purdue University Fort Wayne, and\\xa0Indiana University Fort Wayne. The division moved all departments involved in health care to Indiana University Fort Wayne, and all others into Purdue University Fort Wayne. The Philosophy and Geosciences departments, along with academic programs in French and German, were closed on January 1, 2017.\\n\\nCampus\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe Ron Venderly Family Bridge crosses the\\xa0St. Joseph River, connecting the former McKay Family Farm with the Main Academic Campus.\\n\\nThe Purdue Fort Wayne campus is 688 acres (2.78\\xa0km2), encompassing four main campus areas, including 40 buildings which cover 2,668,078 square feet (247,872.6\\xa0m2).[2]\\xa0The Main Academic Campus, bounded by East Coliseum Boulevard (Indiana State Road 930) to the south, Crescent Avenue to the east,\\xa0St. Joseph River\\xa0to the west, and Canterbury Green Apartment complex and golf course to the north, includes the majority of academic and administrative buildings and parking.\\n\\nThe Waterfield Student Housing Campus, bounded by Crescent Avenue to the west, East Coliseum Boulevard and Trier Road to the south, and Hobson Road to the East, contains all of the privately owned residence halls. The main academic campus and Waterfield campus are connected via the Crescent Avenue Pedestrian Bridge, elevated above Crescent Avenue.\\n\\nThe Research-Incubator Campus, bounded by St. Joe Road to the west, Stellhorn Road to the south, Dean Drive to the north, and Sirlin Drive to the east includes the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center, a\\xa0business incubator\\xa0for entrepreneurs. This area of the campus was acquired in 2007 after the Fort Wayne State Developmental Center\\'s closure,[7]\\xa0with the land donated between IPFW and\\xa0Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana.\\n\\nThe former McKay Family Farm, located on the western bank of the St. Joseph River, is bounded by East Coliseum Boulevard to the south, St. Joseph River to the east, and development to the north and west. The Plex indoor soccer facility,\\xa0Hefner Soccer Complex,\\xa0Holiday Inn\\xa0hotel, and Steel Dynamics Keith E. Busse Alumni Center are located on this portion of the campus, connected to the main academic campus via the pedestrian-only Ron Venderly Family Bridge. The Holiday Inn operates on property leased from the Indiana–Purdue Foundation, and is affiliated with Purdue Fort Wayne\\'s Hospitality Management Program.[8]\\n\\nArchitecture\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nCampus buildings generally feature brick in various shades of brown or tan, a nod to the brick façades of\\xa0Purdue University\\'s\\xa0West Lafayette\\xa0campus buildings. The grounds at Purdue Fort Wayne are manicured and landscaped as a multiple-hundred-acre park due in part to the generosity of Virginia Ayers, an avid long-time exerciser on campus who willed her estate to IPFW upon her death in 1986 (IPFW University Archives).\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nPurdue Fort Wayne is governed by the Purdue University Board of Trustees and the Purdue Fort Wayne Faculty Senate. The Indiana–Purdue Foundation owns most of the land that constitutes Purdue Fort Wayne and has entered into a 99-year lease with\\xa0Allen County\\xa0for additional land for $1.\\n\\nAcademics\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nPurdue University Fort Wayne is accredited by the\\xa0Higher Learning Commission\\xa0and offers more than 200 academic options.[9]\\n\\nColleges, divisions, and schools\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe university\\'s academic programs are divided into several colleges, divisions, and schools:[9]\\n\\nCollege of Liberal Arts\\n\\nCollege of Science\\n\\nCollege of Engineering, Technology, and Computer Science\\n\\nCollege of Visual and Performing Arts\\n\\nDoermer School of Business\\n\\nIntegrated Studies\\n\\nSchool of Education\\n\\nPrior to July 1, 2021, the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Science were combined in the College of Arts and Sciences. On the same date, the College of Professional Studies ceased operations.\\n\\nLibrary system\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe Walter E. Helmke Library, the only public university library in northeast Indiana, was dedicated in 1977 and covers 113,000 square feet (10,500\\xa0m2). Ground was broken in 2009 for a new US$42.4 million Student Services Complex, extending the second floor Learning Commons through a 265 feet (81\\xa0m)-long glass-enclosed elevated walkway, connecting Helmke Library to Walb Student Union and\\xa0Hilliard Gates Sports Center. In November 2011, the Student Services Complex and Learning Commons were opened for use. The Learning Commons includes librarian research consulting, the Writing Center, IT services computing, and areas for group and individual study.[10]\\n\\nAthletics\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article:\\xa0Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons\\n\\nPurdue Fort Wayne student athletes, known as the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons, compete as a\\xa0National Collegiate Athletic Association\\xa0Division I\\xa0school in the\\xa0Horizon League, and in the\\xa0Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association\\xa0for men\\'s volleyball.

Twenty-four years earlier, Indiana University also began offering courses in Fort Wayne.[6] From 1958–1964, both universities began the process of combining the two extension centers into one joint university, known as Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW).\n",
